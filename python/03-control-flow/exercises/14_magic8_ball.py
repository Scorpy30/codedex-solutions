# Codédex solutions
# In this example, we will create a simple Magic 8 Ball program that provides random answers to user questions. The Magic 8 Ball is a toy used for fortune-telling or seeking advice, and it typically provides one of 20 possible answers to yes-or-no questions.

import random

question = input('Question:      ')

random_number = random.randint(1, 9)

if random_number == 1:
  answer = 'Yes - definitely'
elif random_number == 2:
  answer = 'It is decidedly so'
elif random_number == 3:
  answer = 'Without a doubt'
elif random_number == 4:
  answer = 'Reply hazy, try again'
elif random_number == 5:
  answer = 'Ask again later'
elif random_number == 6:
  answer = 'Better not tell you now'
elif random_number == 7:
  answer = 'My sources say no'
elif random_number == 8:
  answer = 'Outlook not so good'
elif random_number == 9:
  answer = 'Very doubtful'
else:
  answer = 'Error'
  
print('Magic 8 Ball:  ' + answer)
